This appears to be a coding exercise about generating dialogue based on whether a person's name is known or not. Let me start by exploring the directory structure to see what files are available.

Let me examine the contents of this file to understand the current implementation and what needs to be modified.

2025-12-08 04:41:44,878 - agent - INFO - [FINISH_FIND_FILES_TO_MODIFY] Next thought: Perfect! I found the file that needs to be modified. The main.js file contains a skeleton for the "Two fer" exercise with a function called `twoFer()` that currently throws an error. Based on the problem statement, this function should accept an optional name parameter and return the appropriate dialogue. If a name is provided, it should return "One for [name], one for me." If no name is provided, it should return "One for you, one for me." I need to implement this logic in the `twoFer` function.
