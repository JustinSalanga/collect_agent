2025-12-08 07:14:01,972 - agent - INFO - [FINISH_FIND_FILES_TO_MODIFY] Next thought: I found the main.js file which contains a skeleton implementation for the "Two fer" exercise. The function `twoFer` is currently throwing an error and needs to be implemented to handle the cookie sharing logic described in the problem statement. Based on the requirements, the function should accept a name parameter and return "One for [name], one for me." if a name is provided, or "One for you, one for me." if no name is provided. This is the only file that needs to be modified.
