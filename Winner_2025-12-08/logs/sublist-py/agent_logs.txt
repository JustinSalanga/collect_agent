2025-12-08 07:12:48,607 - agent - INFO - [FINISH_FIND_FILES_TO_MODIFY] Next thought: I need to understand the repository structure to find the relevant files for this problem. This appears to be a coding exercise about comparing lists to determine if they are equal, one is a superlist of the other, one is a sublist of the other, or they are unequal. Let me start by exploring the directory structure to understand what files are available.

2025-12-08 07:13:01,250 - agent - INFO - [FINISH_FIND_FILES_TO_MODIFY] Next thought: Now I can see the structure of the problem. The file `main.py` contains:
1. Four enumerated constants (SUBLIST, SUPERLIST, EQUAL, UNEQUAL) that are currently set to None
2. A function `sublist(list_one, list_two)` that needs to be implemented
Based on the problem statement, I need to:
1. Set appropriate values for the enumerated constants
2. Implement the `sublist` function to determine the relationship between two lists
The function should return one of the constants based on whether:
- list_one is equal to list_two
- list_one is a superlist of list_two (contains list_two as a contiguous sub-sequence)
- list_one is a sublist of list_two (is contained in list_two as a contiguous sub-sequence)
- they are unequal
This is the only file that needs to be modified to solve the problem.
