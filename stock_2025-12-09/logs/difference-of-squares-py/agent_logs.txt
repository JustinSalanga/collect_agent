2025-12-10 01:57:38,390 - agent - INFO - [FINISH_FIND_FILES_TO_MODIFY] Next thought: I need to understand the project structure first to find the relevant files for this problem. The problem is about calculating the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers. Let me explore the directory structure to see what files are available.

2025-12-10 01:59:09,349 - agent - INFO - [FINISH_FIND_FILES_TO_MODIFY] Next thought: I can see there's a main.py file in the root directory. This is likely where I need to implement the solution for the problem. Let me examine the content of this file to understand what's already there and what needs to be implemented.

2025-12-10 01:59:16,172 - agent - INFO - [FINISH_FIND_FILES_TO_MODIFY] Next thought: Perfect! I can see the main.py file contains three functions that need to be implemented:
1. `square_of_sum(number: int) -> int` - should calculate (1 + 2 + ... + number)²
2. `sum_of_squares(number: int) -> int` - should calculate 1² + 2² + ... + number²
3. `difference_of_squares(number: int) -> int` - should calculate square_of_sum - sum_of_squares
All three functions currently have `pass` statements, so they need to be implemented. This is the only file that needs to be modified to solve the problem.
