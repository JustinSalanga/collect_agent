2025-12-10 01:54:33,110 - agent - INFO - [FINISH_FIND_FILES_TO_MODIFY] Next thought: I need to understand the repository structure to find the files related to the Hamming distance problem. This appears to be a coding exercise where I need to implement a function to calculate the Hamming distance between two DNA strands. Let me start by exploring the directory structure to see what files are available.

2025-12-10 01:54:46,128 - agent - INFO - [FINISH_FIND_FILES_TO_MODIFY] Next thought: Perfect! I found the file that needs to be modified. The `main.js` file contains a skeleton `DNA` class with a `hammingDistance` method that needs to be implemented. Based on the problem statement, I need to:
1. Store the DNA strand in the constructor
2. Implement the `hammingDistance` method to calculate the number of differences between two DNA strands of equal length
The implementation should:
- Store the nucleotides string in the constructor
- In `hammingDistance`, compare each position of the current strand with the comparison strand
- Count and return the number of positions where the nucleotides differ
- Assume both strands have equal length (as stated in the problem)
This is the only file that needs to be modified to solve this problem.
