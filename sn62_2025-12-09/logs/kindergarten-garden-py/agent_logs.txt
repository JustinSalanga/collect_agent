This file contains the skeleton `Garden` class that needs to be implemented according to the problem statement. The class has an `__init__` method that takes a diagram string and an optional students list, and a `plants` method that takes a student name and should return a list of plant names. This is the only file that needs to be modified to solve the problem.
