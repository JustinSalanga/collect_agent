This is likely where the alphametics puzzle solution needs to be implemented. Let me examine the contents of this file to understand the current structure and what needs to be implemented.

2025-12-10 02:45:03,884 - agent - INFO - [FINISH_FIND_FILES_TO_MODIFY] Next thought: I can see that this is a skeleton file for the Alphametics exercise. The file contains a single exported function `solve` that takes a puzzle string and should return either an object mapping letters to numbers or null if no solution exists. This is the only file that needs to be modified to implement the alphametics puzzle solver. The function signature shows it should return `Object.<string, number> | null`, which means it should return an object where keys are letters and values are their corresponding digit assignments, or null if no solution is found.
