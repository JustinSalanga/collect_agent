This is likely where I need to implement the Hamming distance calculation. Let me examine the current content of this file to understand what's already there and what needs to be implemented.

2025-12-08 04:04:38,667 - agent - INFO - [FINISH_FIND_FILES_TO_MODIFY] Next thought: Perfect! I found the file that needs to be modified. The `main.js` file contains a skeleton for the Hamming distance calculation with a `compute` function that currently throws an error. Based on the problem statement, I need to implement the Hamming distance calculation between two DNA strands. The function should:
1. Take two DNA strands as parameters
2. Calculate the number of differences between them
3. Only work for sequences of equal length (should handle error case for different lengths)
This is the only file that needs to be modified to implement the solution.
