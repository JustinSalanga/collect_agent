2025-12-10 01:25:19,180 - agent - INFO - [CREATE_MAIN_AGENT] Next thought: Now I understand the problem better. I have a skeleton implementation in main.js that needs to be completed, and there are tests in test.js that I need to make pass. Let me analyze the current implementation:
1. The current code tries to solve alphametics puzzles by generating all permutations of digits for letters
2. It has functions to convert words to numbers and generate permutations
3. However, there are several issues:
   - The permutation generation is inefficient and may not work correctly for large puzzles
   - The code doesn't handle operators other than addition (subtraction, multiplication, division)
   - The parsing logic might not be robust enough
Let me first run the existing tests to see what's failing:

2025-12-10 01:26:27,976 - agent - INFO - [CREATE_MAIN_AGENT] Next thought: Looking at the test results, I can see that most tests are failing because the solve function is returning null instead of a valid solution. This indicates that the current implementation has issues with:
1. Generating permutations correctly
2. Handling different operators (subtraction, multiplication, division)
3. Parsing the puzzle correctly
Let me analyze the current implementation more carefully. The main issues I can identify are:
1. The permutation generation is inefficient and likely incorrect - it's trying to generate all permutations of 10 digits for the number of unique letters, which is computationally expensive and may not work correctly.
2. The parsing logic only handles addition and doesn't account for other operators like subtraction, multiplication, or division.
3. The equation validation is simplistic and doesn't handle the different operators properly.
Let me first create a hypothesis about what needs to be fixed:
